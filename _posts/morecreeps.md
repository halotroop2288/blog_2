More Creeps and Weirdos Refabricated is an in-progress recreation of the classic [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net)
mod [More Creeps and Weirdos](http://morecreeps.com), for [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net).
Please check it out, if you haven't already!

**The source code is not public, for this project, unfortunately.**

According to the [license terms included with the original mod](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1272354-1-2-5-morecreeps-weirdos-v2-62-slot-machines-old),
creating modified versions for personal use is OK, but redistributing them is not.
I would like to stay on good terms with the author, so I am going to allow him to review it
first, and ask him for permission to release it.
