Ex-Features is (was) an attempt at re-adding all the removed features,
and console/Bedrock Edition-exclusive features.

I got as far as adding some paintings, some blocks,
and a (poorly implemented) recreation of the classic title screen before I gave up on it.
This was one of my earliest projects using the [Fabric](https://www.fabricmc.net) toolchain.

Download the mod, for *[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) version **1.15.2***
**[HERE](https://github.com/halotroop2288/ex-features-mod/releases/download/v0.3.0-alpha/exfeatures-0.3.0+mc1.15.2.jar).**

Check out the source code **[HERE](https://github.com/halotroop2288/ex-features-mod/)**

**You'll need to use [Fabric Mod Loader](https://www.fabricmc.net/use/) and
[Fabric API](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/fabric/files) to make it work.**
