Better Than Updates is an organization, founded by me, dedicated to providing a stable and fleshed-out modding platform
for Minecraft.

Better Than Updates is focused on one version in particular to make creating and maintaining mods less difficult for
everyone involved. That version is Minecraft Beta 1.7.3. A version that is widely believed to be the turning point for
Minecraft's general "feel."

Beta 1.7.3 has several overhaul mods made for it already.
- [Better Than Wolves]
  - Better Than Updates' namesake and inspiration.
  - Changes up the gameplay quite a lot, in ways that mods generally shy away from.
- [New Frontier Craft]
  - The inspiration for choosing this version (we were originally aiming for release 1.5.2, BTW's final release target.)
  - Has an awesome community that creates content for it all the time.
  - Supports accessibility features both original and ported from newer versions of Minecraft.

These open-source overhaul mods will get ported to Fabric using Better Than Updates' inclusive mod development kit with
ensured cross-compatibility.
