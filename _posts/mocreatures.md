[Mo' Creatures](https://www.mocreatures.org/) is a mod by Dr. Zhark,
which has had its source code released under an open license recently.
I am porting it to Fabric Mod Loader while I wait for the original creator of
[More Creeps and Weirdos](../morecreeps) to respond to me about the licensing of that mod.

You can download the original mod **[HERE](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mo-creatures/download/2628698)**.

You can view the source code for my fork (when it's released) **[HERE](https://github.com/halotroop2288/Mo-Creatures)**.

You can download my Fabric port of Moâ€™ Creatures (when it's released) [on the Github releases page](https://github.com/halotroop2288/mo-creatures/releases/latest).
Just grab the latest JAR file.

# [Mobs](https://mocreatures.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Mo%27_Creatures)
Here's the current list of mobs that have been added.

Keep in mind, I'm targeting the whole list of mobs
from Mo' Creatures 12, minus obsolete ones, like Wolves, Kitties, Turtles, etc.
Which will eventually have the option of implementing into vanilla mobs with their features/models.

## Ants
![Ant](./Ant.png)
Ants wander around and look for food to pick up, and then carry it around wherever they go.

(Later, they may bring food back to a nest? Also, they might follow each other around when they've found food?)

## Birds
![Generic Bird](./Bird.png)
Birds are like parrots, but uh... different-looking?
They each have their own ambient noise and can be tamed,
and will give you slow-falling if you have them sit on your head.

## Bunnies
Rabbits have already been added to Minecraft.

## Butterflies and Moths
![Coming Soon](https://halotroop.com/images/ComingSoon.png)

Many species of butterflies and moths can be found in the world of MoCreatures, including:
