Fabricators' Construct is an attempt at rewriting the mod Tinkers Construct for
[Fabric Mod Loader](https://www.fabricmc.net/), managed by my organization,
[halotroop](https://github.com/halotroop/).

The project is on hold at the moment.

You can view the source code **[HERE](https://github.com/halotroop/fabricators-construct)**.

(There are no screenshots to show, unfortunately.
Please check out the original mod,
[Tinkers' Construct](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/tinkers-construct)!)
