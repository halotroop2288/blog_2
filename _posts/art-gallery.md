## Art by [VI Felian](https://twitter.com/ArtByFelian)
My usual avatar, shown on the homepage of this website was created by VI Felian, aka Parasyminus.
He is the artist that I most recommend, if you are looking for any for yourself!

## Coming soon
More art coming soon, which is not currently available for me to add to this site.

## Removals
Some art has been removed due to my negative relationship with the artist(s).
Sorry, if you're disappointed, but this is how I want it to be.
