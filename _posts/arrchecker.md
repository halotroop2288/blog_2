ARRChecker is a simple Fabric mod that checks the licenses of every mod loaded at startup and warns you if they are
not open-source. It is useful for modpack developers that want to make sure it is OK to distribute every mod included.

Download the mod, for *[Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net) version **1.15.2***
