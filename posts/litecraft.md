LiteCraft is an in-progress, but currently on-hold project to create a Minecraft-style
sandbox game that is fully friendly to modders, and welcomes new features being added
to the main game.

I am currently working on a new game utilizing the [Glow](https://github.com/playsawdust/Glow/) engine, with the working title "Project: BrightCraft."
This will be the successor to this LiteCraft project.

Project: BrightCraft will soon get its own page on this site, but until then:
Check out the source code for Project: BrightCraft [HERE](https://github.com/halotroop2288/GlowTest).

## Background
LiteCraft as an idea was born out of observed necessity.
The [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) modding community has a lot of disagreements over
what is the best way to do something, but a lot of us agree on one thing:
We could probably do better than [Mojang](https://mojang.com) themselves.

The problem is: No one has ever stepped up to start a community project to make a better game.
That is, until now. I did just that.
I suggested (very heavily) that we put our resources
into making our own game, rather than constantly fixing Mojang's game.

I got 4 people to work on this game for a while, before it became too stressful to manage
myself, and the other developers left.

What we're left with today is a very unoptimized infinitely generating world with caves,
and no other interactivity.

## Ginger3D
The rendering engine for LiteCraft, called "[Ginger3D](https://github.com/halotroop/Ginger3D)"
was created by the ever-talented [hydos](https://github.com/hYdos), who has driven many
great projects in the past, such as [Legacy Fabric](https://github.com/Legacy-Fabric), and
[JCraft64](https://github.com/hYdos/JCraft64), an attempted port of Project64 to a Minecraft
mod, utilizing Ginger3D.

This engine was originally made for HD games, but after I decided to use it for LiteCraft,
hydos decided to make quite a few changes to it officially, and it became a fully fledged
voxel sandbox game rendering engine!
